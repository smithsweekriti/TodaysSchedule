TodaysSchedule
==============
NITT, being one of the most renowned institute, has innumerous events lined up, almost everyday. Schedule for these events are either communicated via posters, pamphlets or online websites. Though these sources are quite reliable but are often accessed rarely. Also, success key of every painstaking event lies in its marketing strategy. Thus, the need of the hour is to spread the word through the emergence of a mechanism, operating on a technology that everyone owns, ie,  cellphone.
                                                     
PURPOSE

To combat the above stated problem I plan to design a software which would help the event scheduler to communicate the daily agenda along with the changes, if any, regarding the ongoing events such that everyone has the accurate and up-to-date information, right at their finger tips.

SCOPE
On similar lines, I have chosen this project “Today’s Events” which involves displaying the agenda of various events for the day as scheduled by an event scheduler. The scheduler needs to login in order to add event plan which can be referred by the students throughout the day. The project includes  a simple user friendly interface, capable of creating event roasters, storing events, displaying schedule, deleting event plans, etc. 


						
Features :

1.	Create newschedulers
2.	Create event roasters
3.	Store event plans
4.	Update schedule
5.	Display day’s roaster
6.	Remove agenda
7.	Delete or update exiting scheduler
